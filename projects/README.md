- Create a new folder in this folder with the name of your project
- In this new folder:
  - Add python files
  - Add the Jupyter notebook that represents the bulk of your project.
- Make sure to indicate which teammate did which part of the work.
- You can submit code to this repository anytime until the deadline.
