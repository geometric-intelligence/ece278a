# Present a topic

## Guidelines

- Use the conda environment of the class, by running: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Create a new folder in this folder with the name of your topic
- In this new folder:
  - Add python files
  - Add the Jupyter notebook that represents the slides that you will present in class.
- Make sure to indicate which teammate did which part of the work.
- You can submit code to this repository anytime until the day of your presentation

## Grading Criteria

- Structure: Did you respect the structure:
  - Theory
  - Code
  - Recent example using this topic
- Software: does the code run?
- Presentation: is the presentation clear and does it describe well the topic / concept?
