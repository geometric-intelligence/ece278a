# Tutorials: Web Apps

[Example: Image Processing](https://share.streamlit.io/aniketwattamwar/image-processing-with-streamlit/main/main.py)

- First review session: 02/02
- Second review session: 03/07
- Teams of 2-3 students

## Guidelines

- Register for one of the two sessions.
- Download [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- Create a new folder in this folder with the name of your project
- In this new folder:
  - Add python files
  - Add the Python .py that represents the bulk of your project.
- Make sure to indicate which teammate did which part of the work.
- You can submit code to this repository anytime until the deadline.

## Example in `example-app`

The `example-app` folder contains an example of web app. To run it:
- Install the dependencies by creating a conda environment from the `environment.yml` file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Go in the folder `example-app`
- Run `streamlit run main.py` from the command line.

# Grading criteria

- Exhaustive: Does the app cover all the materials seen in class on this topic?
- Comprehensive: Is the app understandable from a newcomer's perspective?
- Self-contained: Are the concepts in the app clear without requiring any additional materials?
- Software: Does the app run without bugs?
- Visuals: Do the visualization help get intuition about the materials?
